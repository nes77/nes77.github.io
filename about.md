I'm a student of software engineering and systems programming, focusing on design of both large, distributed software and software designed to run in constrained environments. 

I also play the sax.

* [**Impactful Optimization**](#) 

    In my experience at Intel, I developed testing infrastructure for a server chip that gave a speedup factor between 32 and 1000, depending on use case. I acheived this by exploiting both concurrency available on the chip being tested (allowing for previously complex testing to be significantly simplified), as well as on the development system to parallelize a previously serial build system.
