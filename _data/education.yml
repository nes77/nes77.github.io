    My coursework included <mark>Machine Learning</mark>,
    <mark>AI</mark>, <mark>Compiler Design</mark>, <mark>DBMS usage and implementation</mark>, <mark>Operating Systems</mark>, and <mark>Functional Programming</mark>.

    In addition, I worked on the Violet Nano-satellite Project Team, where I debugged the communications subsystem by simulating
    the onboard navigation chip using a microcontroller in order to find the cause of a failure in our testing software.
