    As a System Validation Engineer in the Datacenter Group at Intel, I continued work on the Intel network accelerator IP I worked on as an intern.
    My responsibilities included designing, implementing, and debugging testing software and infrastructure, as well as designing validation plans to prove out the functionality of functional unit blocks (FUBs).

    At this position, I've:
      - Worked extensively with <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>C++11</mark>, and <mark>assembly</mark>
      - Implemented a 300x speedup of test infrastructure by selectively lowering computation to <mark>Cython</mark>
      - Led a "Brown Bag" presentation series to promote knowledge sharing across the team's organization
      - Led best-practices workgroups to coordinate <mark>Git</mark> usage across projects
      - Led Python 2 to 3 transition ahead of 2020 Python 2 EOL
      - Implemented a 30% speedup in build time of a critical piece of test infrastructure
      - Integrated and promoted the use of static and runtime analysis tools (i.e. <mark>Clang</mark> tooling) to catch subtle programming errors in a large codebase
      - Designed and implemented a software test framework for testing multiple generations of hardware functionality
      - Wrote a flow control analysis program in <mark>Rust</mark> to enable analysis of compiled assembly
      - Acted as a product owner under the <mark>Agile</mark> sprint and scrum process

    I worked on a proof of concept piece of software using Intel SGX (**S**ecure **G**uard e**X**tensions) to provide
    a confidential, verifiable environment to execute commands from the Ethereum blockchain. I worked under Prof. Emin Gun Sirer.

    Key aspects of the project were:
      - Working in a memory limited environment with no traditional I/O access
      - Developing debugging techniques for an environment with limited visibility

    See Projects below for more details and source code.

    As an Intern doing System Validation in the Datacenter Group at Intel, I worked on a network accelerator IP.

    At this position I:
      - Owned a FUB, closed a significant knowledge gap in functional documentation, and created new tests, closing several coverage gaps
      - Created an application to compile and run tests, providing at least 32x and as much as 100x speedup over existing test infrastructure, leveraging platform <mark>concurrency</mark> and allowing compilation to be offloaded to networked systems
      - Contributed patch to internal <mark>Linux</mark> development driver, part of enabling virtualization support

    At Speare I worked on a content recommendation system for recommending news articles.

    My primary accomplishment was pushing for and implementing the transition of our database software from MongoDB
    to PostgreSQL, as well as working with the CTO on redesigning table schemas to avoid unnecessary joins.
    The resulting changes enabled a 1000x speedup.
